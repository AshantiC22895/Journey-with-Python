Journey with Python for Internships
Hi, I’m Ashanti Cocroft! 
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I’m documenting my journey with Python as I build projects and sharpen my coding skills. My goal is to gain hands-on experience and showcase my work to secure a software engineering internship.

About This Repository
This repository contains Python projects that demonstrate my growing understanding of programming concepts, problem-solving, and building real-world applications. While I’ve been working extensively with C and C++ in my coursework, I’m expanding my knowledge by exploring Python and applying it to practical and fun projects.

What I’m Learning
Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve covered so far:

Core Python Concepts – Variables, data types, loops, and conditionals

Functions and Modules – Writing reusable code and using libraries

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Classes, objects, and inheritance

Backend Development Basics – Flask and Django (currently learning)

File Handling and Data Manipulation – Reading, writing, and analyzing data

Game Development – Building interactive games using Pygame

GUI Development with Tkinter

Featured Projects
Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on to enhance my Python skills:

Color Picker App (Tkinter):
A GUI application that allows users to select colors and displays the corresponding hex code.

Dice Roll Simulator:
Simulates a dice roll and generates random numbers.

Demonstrates understanding of random module and loops.

Password Generator:
Generates secure and random passwords based on user-defined criteria.

Strengthened my skills in string manipulation and randomization.

Simple Login System:
A basic login and authentication system with error handling.

Practiced working with conditionals and user input validation.

Music Player App (Tkinter):
A simple GUI-based music player that plays audio files.

Built using Tkinter and Python’s pygame library for audio playback.

Snake Game (Pygame):
A classic Snake game developed using Python and Pygame.

Demonstrates my understanding of event handling, collision detection, and game loops.

Chatbot (Rule-Based):
Created a simple chatbot capable of responding to basic user queries.

Showcases string manipulation and basic natural language processing fundamentals.

Tic-Tac-Toe with GUI:
Built a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical interface.

Highlights my proficiency in GUI development and algorithmic logic.

 My Goals:
As I continue learning Python and Django, I’m focusing on:

Building full-stack web applications using Django

Exploring REST APIs and backend services

Improving my unit testing skills with unittest

Creating more interactive and dynamic applications

Why This Matters?
I’m passionate about applying my knowledge in a practical setting and contributing to real-world projects. These projects not only strengthen my coding skills but also prepare me for future challenges in the tech industry.
